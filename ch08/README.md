# Chapter 8: model selection and assessment

### Bayesian model comparisons

See [loo-model-comparisons.R](loo-model-comparisons.R) for an example of 
approximate leave-one-capture-history-out model comparison using the 
[loo](https://cran.r-project.org/package=loo) R package.

### Model evaluation

See [predictive-checks.R](predictive-checks.R) and the associated Stan model
for an example of how to compute model fit statistics in the generated 
quantities block.
