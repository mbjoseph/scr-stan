The goal of scr-stan is to provide Stan implementations for a variety of 
spatial capture-recapture models described in the book 
[Spatial Capture-Recapture](https://www.elsevier.com/books/spatial-capture-recapture/royle/978-0-12-405939-9)
by Royle, Chandler, Gardner, and Sollmann.
The emphasis is on translating models from [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/) to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). 

### Why?

Stan is a flexible language that enables full Bayesian inference with dynamic
Hamiltonion Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian inference with automatic
differentiation variational inference, and optimization (e.g., penalized 
maximum likelihood).

There are some good reasons to use Stan: 

- Stan is fast.
- Stan can check your data (e.g., you can 
set bounds on data, and enforce a variety of constraints on data types, 
shapes of arrays, etc.). 
- Stan has good sampling diagnostics (e.g., you'll be more likely to know when sampling from the posterior has gone awry).
- Stan has a healthy and active user community (e.g., on the [Stan Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/)).
- Stan documentation is üëç: https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/

Using Stan can be hard for ecologists with experience in JAGS/BUGS/NIMBLE, because 
[you have to marginalize over discrete parameters](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_23/stan-users-guide/latent-discrete-parameterization.html). 
But, you don't have to start from scratch. 

Hopefully these Stan implementations lower the barrier to entry.

### Dependencies

These examples use the `scrbook` R package, which you can download from here:

### What's here

This repo contains a bunch of Stan translations of JAGS models provided in the
SCR book.

### Inspiration

This repo was built in the spirit of the Hiroki It√¥'s excellent [Stan 
translations of "Bayesian Population Analysis using 
WinBUGS --- A Hierarchical Perspective" (2012) by Marc K√©ry and Michael Schaub](https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/tree/master/BPA).
